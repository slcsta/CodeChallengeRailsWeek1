## PART 4
Create a Category model that just has a name attribute. Each party should belong to a category
Create a Supply model - each supply will have a name attribute. A party can have many supplies and each supply should be able to be used by many parties.
Turn the Party new form into a nested form so that you can choose from an existing category or create a new one when you create a party.
Add fields for supplies so that you can create new supplies when you create a party.
Display the associations on the Party show page.
BONUS IF WE HAVE TIME:
use a different layout for your category model
use a different layout for a categoryâ€™s show page
use partials to clean up your code
use helpers to clean up your code
